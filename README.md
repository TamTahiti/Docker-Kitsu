Those Dockerfiles are based on CG Wire work, a company based in France. They help small to midsize CG studios to manage their production and build a pipeline efficiently.
They apply software craftsmanship principles as much as possible. They love coding and consider that strong quality and good developer experience matter a lot. Through their diverse experiences, they allow studios to get better at doing software and focus more on artistic work.
